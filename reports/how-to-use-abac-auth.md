# Techtonic CMS Auth & Permissions — Beginner Q&A

This document answers the most common questions new users ask about authentication and authorization in Techtonic CMS. It is designed to guide both users and GUI developers.

---

## Authentication (Logging In)

### Q: How do I log in for the first time?

When the server starts, it creates a default admin user. Check your environment configuration for `Admin:Name` and `Admin:Password` (or `.dev.env`). The defaults are usually:

- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`

Send this GraphQL mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
	auth {
		login(name: "admin", password: "admin123") {
			accessToken {
				tokenValue
				expiresAt
			}
			refreshToken {
				tokenValue
				expiresAt
			}
			user {
				id
				name
				status
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Save the `accessToken.tokenValue`. From now on, include it in every request header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>
```

> **Important:** Change the default admin password immediately after first login.

---

### Q: My access token expired. Do I have to log in again?

No. Use your refresh token to get a new pair without re-entering your password:

```graphql
mutation {
	auth {
		refresh(refreshToken: "<your-refresh-token>") {
			accessToken {
				tokenValue
			}
			refreshToken {
				tokenValue
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Each refresh token can only be used once. The old one is invalidated and a new one is issued.

---

### Q: How do I log out?

```graphql
mutation {
	auth {
		logout {
			message
		}
	}
}
```

This immediately invalidates your session. Your access token becomes useless, even if it has not expired yet.

To log out everywhere (all devices):

```graphql
mutation {
	auth {
		logoutAll {
			message
		}
	}
}
```

---

### Q: What is an API key and when should I use it?

An API key is a long secret string you send in the `X-Api-Key` header instead of a JWT token. Use it for:

- Server-to-server scripts
- CI/CD pipelines
- Integrations that do not handle token refresh well

API keys can have expiration dates and work with the same permission system as regular users.

---

## Authorization Basics

### Q: Why was my request denied with "FORBIDDEN"?

The system uses **ABAC** (Attribute-Based Access Control). Every request is checked against **policies** that say "allow" or "deny." If no policy allows your action, you get `FORBIDDEN`.

The default behavior is **deny everything unless explicitly allowed**.

---

### Q: What are the three things I need to manage permissions?

1. **Users** — people who log in
2. **Roles** — named groups like "admin" or "editor"
3. **Policies** — the actual rules that say what is allowed

Think of it like a company:

- **User** = an employee
- **Role** = their job title
- **Policy** = the list of rooms their badge opens

You assign policies to roles, then assign roles to users. You can also assign policies directly to users for one-off exceptions.

---

### Q: What does the admin get by default?

On first startup, the system automatically creates:

- An **admin user**
- An **admin role**
- **64 policies** — one for every possible action on every resource, all set to "Allow"

The admin can do everything out of the box.

---

### Q: Can a user do anything without being given permissions?

Not much. Besides logging in, the default is deny. However, the system automatically grants **creator permissions**:

- If you create a collection, you can edit, delete, and manage its schema
- If you create an API key, you can manage it

These work by comparing the resource creator to the current user. No manual setup needed.

---

## Creating Roles and Policies

### Q: How do I create a new role?

```graphql
mutation {
	roles {
		create(input: { name: "editor", description: "Can manage content" }) {
			id
			name
		}
	}
}
```

Save the returned `id`. You will need it to assign the role to users.

---

### Q: How do I assign a role to a user?

```graphql
mutation {
	users {
		assignRole(input: { userId: "<USER_ID>", roleId: "<ROLE_ID>" })
	}
}
```

You can also set an expiration date:

```graphql
mutation {
	users {
		assignRole(
			input: { userId: "<USER_ID>", roleId: "<ROLE_ID>", expiresAt: "2026-05-26T23:59:59Z" }
		)
	}
}
```

After that date, the role is automatically ignored.

---

### Q: How do I create a simple "allow everything" policy?

Create a policy with **no rules**. A policy with no rules always matches:

```graphql
mutation {
	policy {
		create(
			input: {
				name: "allow-all-collections-read"
				description: "Allow reading all collections"
				effect: Allow
				resourceType: Collections
				actionType: Read
				priority: 100
				isActive: true
				ruleConnector: And
				rules: []
			}
		) {
			id
		}
	}
}
```

Assign this policy to a role, then assign that role to users who need collection read access.

---

### Q: How do I write a rule? What is the `value` field?

Each rule compares an **attribute** to a **value** using an **operator**.

The `value` field is a typed input. You pick exactly one field based on what type of value you need:

| Value field            | GraphQL type    | Example                                            | Use for                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `stringValue`          | `String`        | `value: { stringValue: "editor" }`                 | Text comparisons            |
| `numberValue`          | `Float`         | `value: { numberValue: 42 }`                       | Numbers                     |
| `booleanValue`         | `Boolean`       | `value: { booleanValue: true }`                    | True/false                  |
| `uuidValue`            | `UUID`          | `value: { uuidValue: "a1b2..." }`                  | IDs and GUIDs               |
| `dateTimeValue`        | `DateTime`      | `value: { dateTimeValue: "2026-04-26T09:00:00Z" }` | Timestamps                  |
| `arrayValue`           | `[String!]`     | `value: { arrayValue: ["editor", "admin"] }`       | Lists (with `In` / `NotIn`) |
| `contextReferencePath` | `AttributePath` | `value: { contextReferencePath: SubjectId }`       | `EqContextRef` only         |

**You must provide exactly one field.** The system figures out the `valueType` automatically.

**Special case:** `IsNull` and `IsNotNull` operators do **not** need a `value` at all.

---

### Q: How do I create a policy that only allows certain roles?

Use the `SubjectRole` attribute with the `In` operator and an `arrayValue`:

```graphql
mutation {
	policy {
		create(
			input: {
				name: "editor-can-read-entries"
				effect: Allow
				resourceType: Entries
				actionType: Read
				priority: 500
				isActive: true
				ruleConnector: And
				rules: [
					{
						attributePath: SubjectRole
						operator: In
						value: { arrayValue: ["editor", "admin"] }
						isActive: true
						order: 1
					}
				]
			}
		) {
			id
		}
	}
}
```

Only users with the "editor" or "admin" role will match this policy.

---

### Q: How do I let users only edit their own content?

Use the `EqContextRef` operator with `contextReferencePath`:

```graphql
mutation {
	policy {
		create(
			input: {
				name: "update-own-entries"
				effect: Allow
				resourceType: Entries
				actionType: Update
				priority: 500
				isActive: true
				ruleConnector: And
				rules: [
					{
						attributePath: ResourceEntryCreatedBy
						operator: EqContextRef
						value: { contextReferencePath: SubjectId }
						isActive: true
						order: 1
					}
				]
			}
		) {
			id
		}
	}
}
```

This means: "Allow if the person who created the entry is the same as the current user." No hard-coded user IDs needed.

---

### Q: How do I restrict someone to only one specific collection?

Use `ResourceEntryCollectionId` with the `Eq` operator and a `uuidValue`:

```graphql
mutation {
	policy {
		create(
			input: {
				name: "blog-only-editor"
				effect: Allow
				resourceType: Entries
				actionType: Update
				priority: 500
				isActive: true
				ruleConnector: And
				rules: [
					{
						attributePath: ResourceEntryCollectionId
						operator: Eq
						value: { uuidValue: "e5f6g7h8-1111-2222-3333-444444444444" }
						isActive: true
						order: 1
					}
				]
			}
		) {
			id
		}
	}
}
```

For multiple collections, use `In` with `arrayValue`:

```graphql
{
  attributePath: ResourceEntryCollectionId
  operator: In
  value: { arrayValue: ["uuid-1", "uuid-2"] }
}
```

---

### Q: How do I block access during certain hours?

Create a **Deny** policy with high priority. Deny policies are checked first:

```graphql
mutation {
	policy {
		create(
			input: {
				name: "no-access-after-hours"
				effect: Deny
				resourceType: Entries
				actionType: Read
				priority: 2000
				isActive: true
				ruleConnector: Or
				rules: [
					{
						attributePath: EnvironmentCurrentTime
						operator: Lt
						value: { dateTimeValue: "2026-04-26T09:00:00Z" }
						order: 1
					}
					{
						attributePath: EnvironmentCurrentTime
						operator: Gt
						value: { dateTimeValue: "2026-04-26T17:00:00Z" }
						order: 2
					}
				]
			}
		) {
			id
		}
	}
}
```

`priority: 2000` ensures this runs before normal Allow policies (which usually have priority 100-1000).

## Common Permission Scenarios

### Q: How do I make an "editor" who can create and edit blog posts?

**Step 1:** Create policies for Create, Update, and Read on Entries:

```graphql
mutation {
	p1: policy {
		create(
			input: {
				name: "editor-create-entries"
				effect: Allow
				resourceType: Entries
				actionType: Create
				priority: 500
				ruleConnector: And
				rules: [
					{ attributePath: SubjectRole, operator: In, value: { arrayValue: ["editor"] }, order: 1 }
				]
			}
		) {
			id
		}
	}
	p2: policy {
		create(
			input: {
				name: "editor-read-entries"
				effect: Allow
				resourceType: Entries
				actionType: Read
				priority: 500
				ruleConnector: And
				rules: [
					{ attributePath: SubjectRole, operator: In, value: { arrayValue: ["editor"] }, order: 1 }
				]
			}
		) {
			id
		}
	}
	p3: policy {
		create(
			input: {
				name: "editor-update-own-entries"
				effect: Allow
				resourceType: Entries
				actionType: Update
				priority: 500
				ruleConnector: And
				rules: [
					{ attributePath: SubjectRole, operator: In, value: { arrayValue: ["editor"] }, order: 1 }
					{
						attributePath: ResourceEntryCreatedBy
						operator: EqContextRef
						value: { contextReferencePath: SubjectId }
						order: 2
					}
				]
			}
		) {
			id
		}
	}
}
```

**Step 2:** Create the "editor" role and assign the policies.

**Step 3:** Assign the role to users.

---

### Q: How do I make a "viewer" who can only read but not change anything?

Create a single policy for each resource they should view:

```graphql
mutation {
	policy {
		create(
			input: {
				name: "viewer-read-collections"
				effect: Allow
				resourceType: Collections
				actionType: Read
				priority: 100
				ruleConnector: And
				rules: [{ attributePath: SubjectRole, operator: In, value: { arrayValue: ["viewer"] } }]
			}
		) {
			id
		}
	}
}
```

Create similar policies for `Entries:Read`, `Assets:Read`, etc. Assign them to a "viewer" role.

> **Important:** Do not give them Create, Update, or Delete policies. The default is deny, so they will not be able to modify anything.

---

### Q: How do I give someone temporary access?

When assigning a role or policy, include an `expiresAt`:

```graphql
mutation {
	users {
		assignRole(
			input: { userId: "<USER_ID>", roleId: "<ROLE_ID>", expiresAt: "2026-05-01T00:00:00Z" }
		)
	}
}
```

After the expiration date, the assignment is ignored. The user keeps their account but loses those permissions.

---

### Q: How do I deactivate a user without deleting them?

```graphql
mutation {
	users {
		deactivate(id: "<USER_ID>") {
			id
			status
		}
	}
}
```

This:

- Sets their status to `Inactive`
- Logs them out everywhere immediately
- Prevents them from logging in or refreshing tokens

Their data and role assignments are preserved. To reactivate:

```graphql
mutation {
	users {
		activate(id: "<USER_ID>") {
			id
			status
		}
	}
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: I created a policy but it is not working. Why?

Common reasons:

1. **Not assigned.** Policies do nothing until assigned to a role or user. Check `policy.assignedToRoles` and `policy.assignedToUsers`.
2. **Inactive.** Make sure `isActive: true` on both the policy and the assignment.
3. **Expired assignment.** Check if `expiresAt` has passed on the `UserRole` or `UserPolicy` record.
4. **Wrong resource/action.** A policy for `Collections:Read` will not affect `Entries:Update`.
5. **Cached result.** Permission decisions are cached for a few minutes. Wait a moment or check the audit log.
6. **Priority issue.** If a Deny policy with higher priority matches first, your Allow policy never gets checked.
7. **Wrong value field.** Make sure you use the correct value type for your operator:
   - `In`/`NotIn` require `arrayValue`
   - `EqContextRef` requires `contextReferencePath`
   - `IsNull`/`IsNotNull` must **not** have a `value`
   - Everything else uses `stringValue`, `numberValue`, `booleanValue`, `uuidValue`, or `dateTimeValue`

---

### Q: How do I debug why someone was denied?

Query the audit log:

```graphql
query {
	abacAudits {
		nodes {
			userId
			resourceType
			requestedAction
			decision
			decisionReason
			timestamp
		}
	}
}
```

Look at `decisionReason`:

- `"Denied by policy '...' (priority ...)`" — a Deny policy matched
- `"Allowed by policy '...' (priority ...)`" — an Allow policy matched
- `"No matching allow policy found"` — no policy matched, default deny
- `"No policies assigned to user"` — the user has no applicable policies at all

---

### Q: What does priority do?

Priority is a number. Higher numbers are evaluated first.

- Deny policies should usually have **higher** priority than Allow policies.
- The default admin policies have priority `1000`.
- Creator policies have priority `500`.

Example flow for a request:

1. Check Deny policies at priority 2000 — none match
2. Check Deny policies at priority 1500 — none match
3. Check Allow policies at priority 1000 — admin policy matches — **ALLOWED**

If a Deny policy at priority 2000 had matched, the flow would stop at step 1 with **DENIED**.

---

### Q: What is the difference between `And` and `Or` rule connectors?

- **And** — ALL rules must match for the policy to match
- **Or** — ANY rule matching is enough

Example with And:

```
Rule 1: SubjectRole In ["editor"]
Rule 2: ResourceEntryCreatedBy EqContextRef SubjectId
```

User must be an editor AND the entry creator.

Example with Or:

```
Rule 1: SubjectRole In ["admin"]
Rule 2: ResourceEntryCreatedBy EqContextRef SubjectId
```

User is allowed if they are an admin OR the entry creator.

## GUI Design Notes

Based on these questions, a user-friendly GUI should expose:

### Users Page

- [ ] List users with status (Active/Inactive)
- [ ] Create user with optional initial roles/policies
- [ ] Assign/unassign roles with optional expiration picker
- [ ] Assign/unassign policies with optional expiration and reason fields
- [ ] Activate/deactivate buttons
- [ ] Change password (self vs admin)
- [ ] "Impersonate" or "View effective permissions" button

### Roles Page

- [ ] List roles with assigned policy count
- [ ] Create role with optional initial policies
- [ ] Assign/unassign policies
- [ ] Show which users have this role

### Policies Page

- [ ] List policies with effect (Allow/Deny), resource, action, priority
- [ ] Visual rule builder:
  - Attribute dropdown
  - Operator dropdown
  - Dynamic value input that changes based on operator:
    - Text input for `stringValue`
    - Number input for `numberValue`
    - Toggle for `booleanValue`
    - UUID picker for `uuidValue`
